# SonarQube Scanner Skill

Integrates SonarQube static analysis via the sonar-scanner CLI and SonarQube Web API. Fetches quality gate results from api/qualitygates/project_status, parses issues via api/issues/search, and maps findings to source lines for inline code review annotations.

## Local Hermes setup

This machine has a local SonarQube review stack:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Container | `sonarqube-local` |
| Image | `sonarqube:community` |
| UI/API | `http://localhost:9000` |
| Scanner | Docker image `sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli:latest` |
| Review helper | `~/AppData/Local/hermes/scripts/sonarqube-review.sh` |
| Env file | `~/AppData/Local/hermes/sonarqube/sonar.env` |

Use SonarQube **only when reviewing code / tester verification**, not during ordinary implementation unless explicitly requested.

Run from a repository root:

```bash
~/AppData/Local/hermes/scripts/sonarqube-review.sh "$(pwd)" "$(basename "$(pwd)" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
```

The helper starts SonarQube if needed, runs scanner in Docker, writes `.sonarqube-quality-gate.json` and `.sonarqube-issues.json`, then prints `SONAR_SUMMARY quality_gate=<status> unresolved_issues=<count>`.

## Installation

Use the upstream install or setup path that matches your environment:
- Make sure that you follow our [code style](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-developer-toolset#code-style) and all tests are passing (Travis build is executed for each pull request).
- yarn
- yarn build
- yarn generate-translation-keys

Requirements and caveats from upstream:
- Native Git - Must be installed and available in your PATH
- But if your contribution also contains UI changes, you must clone the sonarqube-webapp repository, do your changes there, build it locally and then build the sonarqube repository using the WEBAPP_BUILD_PATH environmen...

Basic usage or getting-started notes:
- Java 17 - Required to build the project
- npm - Required for building
- Tests - Can be disabled if needed by adding -x test to the gradle command (useful if you just want to build without running tests)
